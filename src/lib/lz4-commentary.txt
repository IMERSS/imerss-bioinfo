This implementation was grabbed from the inside of the bower package for the 0.6.0 release of 
https://github.com/pierrec/node-lz4 since
 - the build/lz4.js file was found to be mysteriously irrelevant, despite being updated recently
 - the actual build shell script failed even when tested in a Linux VM on "not finding ./bindings", perhaps a node mismatch issue
 
There is a sign we could revisit this at some point and produce a smaller and more reproducible decoder by mashing
together the 3 files in "Benzinga's" https://github.com/Benzinga/lz4js

Better notion: Move to standard zlib operated by pako https://github.com/nodeca/pako
