<h1>IMERSS Biodiversity Visualisations Portal</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:3rem">
    <a href="http://imerss.org">IMERSS</a>, the Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea,
    is building a federated collection of datasets on biodiversity for localities in the area, together with
    matching configurations of our web-based visualisation software. This mini-portal collects links to the data and
    these visualisations as hosted in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub pages</a> and elsewhere. As well as showcasing the datasets themselves,
    this collection also highlights the flexibility of the visualisation framework and its ease of adaptation to
    map-based or non map-based data, with the ability to weave content from artists, designers, developers and local communities
    into the presentation.
</p>
<h2 id="core">Visualisations using core biodiversity framework</h2>
Despite their diversity, all of the visualisations in this section use a common codebase, presenting either checklists or catalogues
of biodiversity observations in various forms: Different kinds of hierarchical text-based summaries, a circular "starburst"
visualisation optionally together with map-based plots of observations and controls for filtering based on datasets.
All data underlying and code implementing these visualisations is hosted in the
<a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/imerss-bioinfo">IMERSS Bioinformatics Working Group repository</a> on GitHub.

<h3 id="galiano">Galiano Life List</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="Galiano Life List.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Galiano.jpg"></a>
</div>
The <a href="Galiano Life List.html">Galiano Life List</a> is a basic visualisation of a species checklist without
georeferencing data, showing the checklist and sunburst tabs with a taxon information panel,

This visualisation may be seen hosted in various configurations with slightly different styling on the
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/">Biodiversity Galiano</a> web site (currently implemented in WordPress)
on pages such as <a href="https://biogaliano.org/taxa/">Life List</a>,
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/spiders/">Spiders</a> and
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/butterflies-and-moths/">Butterflies and Moths</a>.

A variant configuration, using miniature "phylopics" from artist Kath Boake Wüthrich to illustrate taxa of interest on the sunburst,
as well as a overall representation of Life contributed by artist Susan Taylor, "The Importance of Plankton"
can be seen at the BioGaliano <a href="https://biogaliano.org/web-of-life-viz/">Web of Life</a>.

<p>Our best-curated dataset, the result of a 2 year process of repeatedly reconciling:</p>
<ul><li> On the one hand, upstream data from numerous

</p>

<p>As a result of discrepancies arising in the observation counts as a result of some observations being eliminated
    as part of the submission of the final dataset to GBIF, the configuration visualisation submitted to the journal was
    a <a href="Data Paper Part I Visualisation.html">stripped-down map</a> just showing datasets and observation counts.
    However, a <a href="dataPaperSunburstAndMap.html">full visualisation</a> of the data is also available here showing the full datasets in their
    original form with the same panels as seen in the Life List above, together with the map view.

<h2>Scrollytelling visualisations</h2>

</div>

We help diverse communities to work with data in formats they are comfortable with, with tools they are
familiar with. The <a href="https://imerss.github.io/r-scrollytelling-template/R-Markdown-Background-Reknitted.html">R Markdown Scrollytelling Template</a>
empowers naturalists with moderate technical skills to edit documents in simply structured
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> format, of which the web output is then rewoven into an
interactive <a href="https://imerss.github.io/r-scrollytelling-template/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html">scrollytelling interface</a>. These documents are hosted in
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> where any member may easily update and republish their documents without needing to consult a technician.
The template can be adopted by forking its <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/r-scrollytelling-template">GitHub project</a> and customising it to your ends.

Several projects have already been built using this template, listed below.

<h3 id="maxwell">Maxwell Creek watershed project</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Maxwell.jpg"></a>
</div>
The first community to adopt the R Markdown Scrollytelling framework was the
<a href="https://transitionsaltspring.com/maxwell-creek-watershed-project/">Maxwell Creek Watershed Project</a>
project undertaken with <a href="https://transitionsaltspring.com/">Transition Salt Spring</a>. The Maxwell Creek Watershed Project
is tackling the complexities of addressing cumulative impacts of climate change on local ecosystems while also
navigating interagency collaboration. The ultimate goal of the Project is to better understand and define the
efficacy of nature-based solutions, such as the installation of green infrastructure,
in increasing climate resilience and enhancing ecological integrity and biodiversity.

A work in progress <a href="https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html">scrollytelling presentation</a>
of the project's area and aims is available in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.

Harvey Janszen (July 11, 1946–May 10, 2021) was an accomplished amateur botanist and naturalist endeared to many in British Columbia's
natural history community. During his career, Harvey collected over 3,000 vascular plant specimens,
mostly from the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, and curated comprehensive species checklists
documenting the flora of the southern Gulf Islands, Saanich Peninsula, San Juan Islands, and various other
localities throughout the Salish Sea.

Honouring and curating his legacy is a

</div>

A short distance from Vancouver, the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/eu-na/atlka7tsem_howe-sound">Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Reserve</a>
encompasses the fjord and islands of Átl’ka7tsem/Howe Sound over a 218,723 ha, of which 16% are marine areas.
This mountainous coastal ecosystem of great altitudinal range influenced by the Pacific Ocean, is home to high levels of biodiversity,
with some 721 native terrestrial animal species including grizzly bears, wolverines and bald eagles.
It also sustains thousands of marine species, including living glass sponge reefs, which were long thought to have gone extinct 40 million years ago.

Átl’ka7tsem (pronounced At-Kat-sum) is the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh/Squamish word for paddling up the Sound and First Nation people have prospered in the region since time immemorial.

IMERSS is developing a <a href="https://imerss.github.io/howe-sound-mapping/R-Markdown-AHSBR_Map_1-Reknitted.html#">scrollytelling visualisation<a>
    of the vascular plant diversity of the reserve, which integrates the scrollytelling framework together with the
    <a href="#core">core biodiversity framework</a> together with the <a href="#inat-components">iNaturalist observations widgets</a> developed by
    Ben Keen, a highly experienced developer who is also a resident of the region.

    <h2>Components from Ben Keen</h2>
    Kindly contributed to IMERSS by <a href="https://github.com/benkeen">Ben Keen</a> are components for working with species checklists and
    presenting observations reported to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>.

    <div class="float">
        <a href="https://bcleps.weebly.com/inat.html"><img src="img/thumbs/BCLeps.jpg"></a>
    </div>
    Some prebuilt <a href=https://reactjs.org/">React</a> components to display iNaturalist data on your own sites.
    The original goal was to provide
    add an interactive page to the <a href="https://bcleps.weebly.com/inat.html">BC Lepidoptera website</a> so
    visitors could see some high-level information about
    lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) spotted in British Columbia. But the code was written to allow it to be
    re-used by any website and for any taxon or place. Code for these components is housed in the
    <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/inat-components">IMERSS inat-components</a> repository.

    A simple tool that converts a CSV file into a checklist of rows, grouped by hierarchy. See the <a href="https://imerss.github.io/checklist-generator/">live site</a>
    for an explanation of the functionality. Code for this component is housed in the <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/checklist-generator">IMERSS checklist-generator</a>
