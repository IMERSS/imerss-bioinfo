Sarcocornia) and shows Salicornia pacifica present in BC.Salicornia perennis is excluded. http://data.canadensys.net/vascan/search?q=sarcocorniaSo, you could move ahead of the pack and call your material Salicornia pacifica Standley sensu Piirianen et al. 2017 OR you could use the synonym Sarcocornia pacifica.
