Perdita elongaticeps could not be found.
There is Hoplitis elongaticeps but it seems too distant.

Assumed Lasioglossum pruinosus -> Lasioglossum pruinosiforme -> Lasioglossum semicaeruleum

Hesperapis cockerelli could not be found - NCBI has it "unverified", not known at EOL, etc.

Anthophorula solidaginis could not be found, perhaps Exomalopsis solidaginis? 

Stelis paiute - Attested in https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26213778/ -> add to iNat ADDED

Lithurge apicalis could not be found, perhaps Lithurgopsis apicalis?

Eucera primaveris - Attested at https://essigdb.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/eme_species_query?step=detail&seq_num=44844
although https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Eucera+primiveris suggests it is actually primiveris and that
primaveris is "incorrect spelling". Added as typo

Lasioglossum tegulariformis attested at https://bigcb.berkeley.edu/cgi/bigcb_speclist_show?ItemID=1628&Admin=&username= as Crawford 1907
