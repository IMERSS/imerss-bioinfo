S-axwa' is a preferred shellfish–easy to dry, large and tasty. Those harvested in some areas are sweeter in taste than others. Fresh s-axwa' have been traded to the Interior and are an extremely valuable trade item. Shellfish are valuable to communities that do not readily have access to the ocean. If you hang a sack/bucket of s-ts'eyhw for 2-3 days, the clams clean themselves. S-ts'eyhw s-axwa' (dried butter clams) are also an important food for winter stores.

On average, haan are a small salmon (1-2.5 kg), recognizable by their small scales and the black spots on the tail and upper body. Males develop a humped back during spawning migration. After hatching, fry head downstream to the ocean right away. Shallow inshore and freshwater estuaries are important habitat for juveniles. Haan is leaner than other salmon species and easier to preserve. Haan are not a commercial species as they are harder to process because the meat goes soft and mushy very easily. Haan has been fished by Cowichan as far up the Fraser as Yale. Like thuqi', haan is present in the Cowichan River system; they were once rare in the Cowichan River, but are now found in huge numbers.
