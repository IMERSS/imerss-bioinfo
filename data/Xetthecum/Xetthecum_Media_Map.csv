It dances to a Puneluxutth’ song titled, “imush ‘q’uyatl’un” (“be with me snail”), and is accompanied by text written by the singer/story teller, Florence James, Thiyaas (a Puneluxutth’ elder). It is a simple story, which explains the importance of moving slowly, paying attention, and observing every little aspect of the environment. It is a video that draws attention to an animal who is rarely observed – an animal whose intertidal landscape is severely threatened. Video produced by Karolle Wall.",Class,Eelgrass Beds
