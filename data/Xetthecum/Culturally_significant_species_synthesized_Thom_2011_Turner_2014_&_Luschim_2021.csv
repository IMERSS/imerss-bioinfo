If you are looking for reefs for collecting resources or as a navigational aid, q'am' is an important indicator. Q'am'  is also an important habitat for fish and other marine organisms. One of the practical uses of q'am' is to use the hollow stock steaming wooden hooks, bows and hoops. The shuyutun or leaf portion is used to line your canoe or container, and cover to keep your catch cool and fresh, especially in the summer. It is also a place to anchor or tie up and lets you know where to spear fish. It has been used as a foghorn in the past.

Holding a yuxwule' feathew bestows a peek at the virtues of its original owner. Cultural value is not always immediately visible, and yuxwule' is an example of this–not because of its food or material value but as a result of its ability to hunt and provide for its young, its ability to fish and catch game much larger than itself, and its ability to soar effortlessly above the highest mountains.

Swakwun is thought to have a mournful cry, much the same as one would moan from aching and suffering from severe arthritis.

When flying, the flock flies close to the water and in a straight line like a train. Sxeetth is an important food source especially in winter. Even the brains are used. Sxeetth come when you need them the most. Lights are fastened on the end of the canoe so you can see them at night. When there are lots of them, you can hear them hum.

The herring eggs take some flavour from the boughs. Thq'iinlhp has a milder taste then some of the other conifers.

Catching thuqi' in the Gulf Islands early in the season is a great advantage. Fishing in areas such as the waters west of Pender Island mean that we can supply salmon to other communities before thuqi' began running into the river systems. Thuqi' caught by trolling, traps and nets, are often smoked and used for community purposes or traded. Hul'q'umi'num people often traded smoked sockeye salmon to the mainland. Thuqi' is one of the richer salmon species and more care is required when smoking them. There are three ways to dry salmon: sh-shamus (lightly smoked); s-ts'ehw (smoked really dry); and s-t-eel (cut a certain way to make very thin, so as to dry more easily). ",1,1,0,1,1,0,Thom 2011,
Marine Animals,Oncorhynchus tshawytscha,species,spring salmon,stth'a'qwi',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,le saumon quinnat,"One of the first salmon to head up-river (they used to arrive in Cowichan in early May each year), stth'a'qwi' have suffered dramatic over-fishing and as a result no longer arrive in spring time. Stth'a'qwi' do not generally arrive to lay their eggs until mid to late summer. Stth'a'qwi' spawn in the upper reaches of river systems. Smaller or medium-sized stth'a'qwi' are preferred for their taste. Stth'a'qwi' that have traveled up river become dark or black and are called si-ne'uts. Because these fish are not as rich or fat, they are preferred for smoking. Stth'a'qwi' from the Shaw Creek area are sought after for this reason. The skin of larger stth'a'qwi' can be used for raincoats because of their size and waterproof nature. ",1,1,1,1,1,0,Thom 2011,
Marine Animals,Platichthys stellatus,species,starry flounder,p'uwi',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,le flet etoile,"At 25 to 45 cm long, p'uwi' is larger than lhumuq'e. P'uwi' is also darker in coloration, with a dark grey to dark green upper body and a white underbelly. The lateral (side) fins have black and white stripes that help to differentiate them from other similar species. P'uwi' is an important food species that can be caught at times when salmon is not available. P'uwi' are often caught with a spear or hook and line. ",1,1,0,0,1,0,Thom 2011,
Marine Animals,Oncorhynchus mykiss,species,steelhead,s-xuw'q'um' / sh-ya',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,le truite arc-en-ciel,"S-xuw'q'um' (sh-ya') are actually a sea-run kw'suts that return to the rivers from the ocean during the winter high waters. As the high waters flood the river system creating clouded waters, s-xuw'q'um are most often caught by hook and line. S-xuw'q'um is the name for the fish when they are fresh and silver. Sh-ya' refers to the fish when they are getting silver and returning to the sea. The name sh-ya' comes from the word ya'thut, which translates literally to 'back up'. Sh'ya' are the only trout to go out to sea and then come back up the river to spawn. They are a type of rainbow trout. ",1,1,1,0,1,0,Thom 2011,

Marine Animals,Hypomesus pretiosus,species,surf smelt,stsa'kwum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,l'eperlan argente,Stsa'kwum were at one time much more numerous but can still be found in inshore areas as well as deep water. They come into extreme shallow water on fine gravel beaches to spawn. They can spawn almost year round but most commonly spawn in winter and in summer. They are an important food for stsa'tx and the salmon species. Stsa'kwum is a fish that can be eaten fresh or smoked. The name stsa'kwum comes from the word tsam–which means to go uphill. This come from the spawning activity of stsa'kwum. They swim up the beach to spawn on the sand or fine gravel. ,1,1,0,0,1,0,Thom 2011,
Marine Animals,Oncorhynchus,species,trout (in general),kw'suts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,la truite,"Each trout species has its own specific type of habitat but kw'suts can be found in all reaches of the rivers and small connecting streams. Kw'suts, like the'wun, suffer from habitat loss and are not nearly as numerous or as sizeable as they once were. It was once considered the norm to find kw'suts in small creeks that would reach up to a metre in size. Kw'suts is the general term used for the various trout species except steelhead. Kw'suts are considered very important at times of the year when it was not possible to harvest salmon or other food resources. Kw'suts re often found in side channels and the higer reaches of rivers that are not as affected as the main channel of a river during floods.",1,1,0,0,1,0,Thom 2011,

They are often caught in river systems but may be caught in the ocean as well. Qwtaythun are a delicacy, and are sometimes seen in the Cowichan River system but more commonly in the Fraser River. Qwtaythun in the Cowichan River are seen in the spring and summer. Qwtaythun are also taken as bycatch in the same areas fished for q'eq'o'. ",1,1,1,0,1,0,Thom 2011,

Sum'sum'-ay'elu make paper-like nests from clays and soils. The nests are usually suspended above ground but some species prefer to build them underground or in rotted logs and stumps. The outer paper material from the sum'sum'-ay'elu is valued for cultural purposes and the larvae can be used for bait. The general name now used for bees and wasps is sum'suma'yu.
