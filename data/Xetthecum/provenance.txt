AS 13/2/22: for names, G H I in descending rank order of priority

I am still not sure whether we will be able to use the content from X
It should theoretically be OK, as long as the source was cited... but apparently the Hul'qumi'num Treat Group has stopped publishing this text
it may not be wise for us to use it
I think that perhaps the best thing we could do is to note the values as symbolized in Y through AD

Columns Y through AD
the values are ascribed in a binary 1/0
Md = medicinal
Fd = Food
Sp = Spiritual
Mt = Material
Tr = Trade
Id = Indicator

cultural indicator species
things like....
When the Salmonberry bird sings, the salmonberries ripen
and not long thereafter the sockeye salmon begin their run in the Fraser River
they are cultural / phenological indicators

Hunterston Farms bioblitz data: email from Andrew Simon of 26/02/22

Recently I received a slew of Bioblitz data from Hunterston Farms, which is part of the Xetthecum project boundary.

Please find attached a long-form catalog in CSV format which I have georeferenced so that these data can be pulled into our visualization and parsed by ecosystem type.

I did my best to correct errors as they emerged during curation, but there are going to be a bunch of mistakes that we'll need to deal with systematically following the usual protocols. If you can please send me an output of the mismatched names in relation to the iNat taxonomy, that would be great.

Once I correct those names, I will send you and updated dataset and we can then take the following steps to finalize our biodiversity data for this pilot project:

1) Pull the latest iNaturalist data, which will include records from recent sampling events at Xetthecum (I don't anticipate collecting any more data for this pilot project)

2) Synthesize the updated iNaturalist data + data from our marine zoology paper + the data from the Hunterston Farms 2010 Bioblitz

3) Export data as a CSV so that I can incorporate into my GIS for georeferencing corrections

4) Correct georeferencing

5) Finalize / integrated biodiversity dataset for the Xetthecum project
