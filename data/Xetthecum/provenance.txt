I am still not sure whether we will be able to use the content from X
It should theoretically be OK, as long as the source was cited... but apparently the Hul'qumi'num Treat Group has stopped publishing this text
it may not be wise for us to use it
I think that perhaps the best thing we could do is to note the values as symbolized in Y through AD

Columns Y through AD
the values are ascribed in a binary 1/0
Md = medicinal
Fd = Food
Sp = Spiritual
Mt = Material
Tr = Trade
Id = Indicator

cultural indicator species
things like....

they are cultural / phenological indicators
