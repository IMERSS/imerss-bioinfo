<h1>IMERSS Biodiversity Visualisations Portal</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:3rem">
    The Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea (<a href="http://imerss.org">IMERSS</a>)
    is building a federated collection of datasets on biodiversity for localities in the area, together with
    matching configurations of our web-based visualisation software. This portal collects links to the data and
    these visualisations as hosted in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub pages</a> and elsewhere. Taken as a whole,
    this collection highlights the flexibility of the visualisation framework and its ease of adaptation to
    map-based or non map-based data, with the ability to weave content from artists, designers, developers and local communities
    into the presentation.

</div>
The <a href="https://imerss.github.io/galiano-marine-animal-atlas/Annelida-Reknitted.html#">Galiano Marine Atlas</a>
presents the marine animals of Galiano Island broken down into 18 major phyla. Each group, for example
<a href="https://imerss.github.io/galiano-marine-animal-atlas/Annelida-Reknitted.html">Annelids</a>,
<a href="https://imerss.github.io/galiano-marine-animal-atlas/Mollusca-Reknitted.html">Molluscs</a>,
<a href="https://imerss.github.io/galiano-marine-animal-atlas/Tunicata-Reknitted.html">Tunicates</a>, etc. are framed in a scrollytelling narrative foregrounding their taxonomic interest,
notable observations in the area and community contributions to their understanding. A vignette also contrasts the
coverage of historical, scholarly observations with more recent efforts derived from citizen science.

<h3 id="howe">Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Vegetation Analysis</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/howe-sound-mapping/R-Markdown-AHSBR_Map_1-Reknitted.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Howe.jpg"></a>
</div>

A short distance from Vancouver, the <a href="https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/eu-na/atlka7tsem_howe-sound">Átl’ḵa7tsem/Howe Sound Biosphere Reserve</a>
encompasses the fjord and islands of Átl’ka7tsem/Howe Sound over a 218,723 ha area.

Átl’ka7tsem (pronounced At-Kat-sum) is the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh/Squamish word for "paddling up the Sound".

IMERSS is developing a biodiversity assessment framework for the region (e.g., a
prototype <a href="https://imerss.github.io/howe-sound-mapping/R-Markdown-AHSBR_Map_1-Reknitted.html#">scrollytelling visualisation</a>
of the region's vascular plant diversity). This evolving framework integrates several components of our
biodiversity data science infrastructure, including the scrollytelling and
<a href="#core">core biodiversity framework</a>, as well as <a href="#inat-components">iNaturalist observations widgets</a> developed by
Howe Sound resident Ben Keen.


<h3 id="maxwell">Maxwell Creek watershed project</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Maxwell.jpg"></a>
</div>
Development of the R Markdown Scrollytelling framework began with the
<a href="https://transitionsaltspring.com/maxwell-creek-watershed-project/">Maxwell Creek Watershed Project</a>
project undertaken with <a href="https://transitionsaltspring.com/">Transition Salt Spring</a>.
The ultimate goal of the Project is to better understand and define the
efficacy of nature-based solutions for forest and hydrological restoration, towards enhanced
ecological integrity and biodiversity in the Maxwell Creek watershed.

This <a href="https://imerss.github.io/maxwell/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html">scrollytelling presentation</a>
of the project is a work in progress, available in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.

<h3 id="janszen">Janszen Legacy Project</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/janszen-legacy-storymap/Janszen_Legacy_Project-Reknitted.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Janszen.jpg"></a>
</div>

Harvey Janszen (July 11, 1946–May 10, 2021) was an accomplished amateur botanist and naturalist endeared to many in British Columbia's
natural history community. During his career, Harvey collected over 3,000 vascular plant specimens,
mostly from the southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, and curated comprehensive species checklists
documenting the flora of the southern Gulf Islands, Saanich Peninsula, San Juan Islands, and various other
localities throughout the Salish Sea.

This <a href="https://imerss.github.io/janszen-legacy-storymap/Janszen_Legacy_Project-Reknitted.html">scrollytelling storymap</a>
presents a summary of the progress being made to preserve Harvey's work, with support from the Canadian Institute for
Ecology and Evolution.


<h3 id="scrolly">R Markdown Scrollytelling Template</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/r-scrollytelling-template/R-Markdown-Background-Reknitted.html"><img src="img/thumbs/R-Scrolly.jpg"></a>
</div>

The above scrollytelling visualisations were built from on this common framework which is available for other
communities to adapt. The <a href="https://imerss.github.io/r-scrollytelling-template/R-Markdown-Background-Reknitted.html">R Markdown Scrollytelling Template</a>
empowers naturalists with moderate technical skills to edit documents in simply structured
<a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> format, the web output of which is then rewoven into an
interactive <a href="https://imerss.github.io/r-scrollytelling-template/R-Markdown-Background-Rewoven.html">scrollytelling interface</a> hosted in
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.
The template can be adopted by forking its <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/r-scrollytelling-template">GitHub project</a> and customising it to your ends.

<h2 id="core">Visualisations using core biodiversity framework</h2>
Despite their diversity, all of the visualisations in this section use a common codebase, presenting either checklists or catalogues
of biodiversity observations in various forms, including hierarchical text-based summaries, circular "starburst"
visualisations, optional maps and controls for filtering based on datasets.
All data underlying and code implementing these visualisations is hosted in the
<a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/imerss-bioinfo">IMERSS Bioinformatics Working Group repository</a> on GitHub.

<h3 id="galiano">Galiano Life List</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="Galiano Life List.html"><img src="img/thumbs/Galiano.jpg"></a>
</div>
The <a href="Galiano Life List.html">Galiano Life List</a> presents a basic visualisation of a species checklist without
georeferencing data, showing the checklist and sunburst tabs with a taxon information panel. This visualisation may be
seen hosted in various configurations with slightly different styling on the
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/">Biodiversity Galiano</a> web site (currently implemented in WordPress)
on pages such as <a href="https://biogaliano.org/taxa/">Life List</a>,
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/spiders/">Spiders</a> and
<a href="https://biogaliano.org/butterflies-and-moths/">Butterflies and Moths</a>.

A variant configuration, using miniature "phylopics" from artist Kath Boake Wüthrich to illustrate taxa of interest on the sunburst,
as well as a overall representation of Life contributed by artist Susan Taylor, "The Importance of Plankton"
can be seen at the BioGaliano <a href="https://biogaliano.org/web-of-life-viz/">Web of Life</a>.

<h2>Components from Ben Keen</h2>
Kindly contributed to IMERSS by <a href="https://github.com/benkeen">Ben Keen</a> are components for working with species checklists and
presenting observations reported to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>.
<h3 id="inat-components">iNaturalist observations widget</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://bcleps.weebly.com/inat.html"><img src="img/thumbs/BCLeps.jpg"></a>
</div>
Prebuilt <a href=https://reactjs.org/">React</a> components to display iNaturalist data on your own sites.
The widget was originally implemented to provide
an interactive page on the <a href="https://bcleps.weebly.com/inat.html">BC Lepidoptera website</a> so
visitors could see some high-level information about butterflies and moths spotted in British Columbia.
However, the code was written to allow it to be
re-used by any website, to visualise any taxon or place. Code for these components is housed in the
<a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/inat-components">IMERSS inat-components</a> repository.

<h3>Checklist generator</h3>
<div class="float">
    <a href="https://imerss.github.io/checklist-generator/"><img src="img/thumbs/Checklist.jpg"></a>
</div>
A simple tool that converts a CSV file into a checklist of rows, grouped by hierarchy. See the <a href="https://imerss.github.io/checklist-generator/">live site</a>
for an explanation of the functionality. Code for this component is housed in the <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/checklist-generator">IMERSS checklist-generator</a>
repository.
