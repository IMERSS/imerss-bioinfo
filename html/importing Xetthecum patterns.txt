How to import Xetthecum SVG patterns:

i) Cut and paste in the file contents from the original SVG file, 
e.g. %bagatelle/data/Xetthecum/images/Xetthecum tiles_marine - Trincolmali.svg
ii) Top and tail the root <svg> tag from it
iii) Choose a width and height in the parent <pattern> element of 600, and choose an appropriate pattern scale,
e.g. patternTransform="scale(0.2)"
iv) Adjust any rectangles which are VERY CLOSE to 0,0, 600,600 in the pattern so that they fill the rectangle exactly
v) Rename each clip path and reference to it so that they are unique within xetthecum-patterns.html - e.g.
clip-path-1 -> clip-path-mf-1
